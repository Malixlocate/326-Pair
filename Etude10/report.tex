\selection{Brief:}
We’re observing the way the computer store different number types in memory, and how this may or may not cause effects in the calculated results.

Using Java, we’ve conducted the following experiments(better words needed):

\begin{itemize}
  \item Created a method calculating Harmonic series using single precision floating point values and double precision floating point values
  \item Created a method calculating Cosine series using floating point values, and double precision floating point values
  \item Used the built in Cosine function to calculate the same previous series, using single precision floating point values and double precision floating point values
  \item Created a method calculating a true identity for different values, using single precision floating point values
\end{itemize}
